# Robot End Effector 6D Pose Estimation with Modified DETR

This repository provides a modified version of [DETR (DEtection TRansformers)](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detr), designed specifically for 6D pose estimation of robot end effectors. In this setup:

- The package predicts both the position and orientation of the robotâ€™s end effector.
- Orientation is predicted in quaternion format for more precise rotational control.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository:
    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```
2. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. **Remove the existing Git history (optional):**
    If you cloned the repository and want to start fresh without any existing `.git` history:
    ```bash
    rm -rf .git
    git init
    ```

## Training

To train the model with multiple processes, use the following command:
```bash
torchrun --nproc_per_node=n main.py
```
Replace `n` with the number of processes you want to run concurrently.

## Data Format

Ensure your data follows the expected format:
- **Position:** Provided in 3D coordinates `[x, y, z]`.
- **Orientation:** Represented as a quaternion `[w, x, y, z]`.

## Key Files

- `main.py` - Main training script for running the modified DETR model.
- `dataset.py` - Custom dataset loading script designed to handle 6D pose data for end effectors.
- `models/` - Contains model architecture and modifications applied to DETR.

## Notes

- The model is designed to work with quaternion outputs for orientation, which avoids singularities associated with Euler angles and allows continuous and unambiguous rotational representation.
